   <p>The second big release of this Sankranthi season is Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikunthapuramlo. It has hit the screen today and let’s see whether Bunny makes a comeback or not.</p>
  <strong>Story:</strong>
  <p>Valmiki(Murali Sharma) is a small-time employee in a big company. During his son’s (Sushanth) birth, his boss’s wife (Tabu) also gives birth to a baby boy (Allu Arjun). But upset with his financial status, Valmiki cleverly interchanges the babies and brings the boss’s kid to his house and raises him. As time passes by, a tragic turn around of events happen and the truth is out in the open finally. The rest of the story is as to how Allu Arjun known as Bantu sets things right.</p>
  <strong>plus points:-</strong>
  <p>The story idea is very good and Trivikram has given his own spin to the film with solid dialogues and breezy narration. From start to end, Ala Vaikunthapuramlo has non stop entertainment which will please everyone completely.</p>
  <p>Allu Arjun is in his elements and proves that a star like him cannot be pinned back for long. Bunny’s all-round performance is the biggest highlight of the film. His dances, comic timing, and performance will be a treat for everyone. Bunny has grown as an actor as all his scenes with Murali Sharma have been designed quite well.</p>
  <strong>Minus Points:</strong>
  <p>The villain’s track is a bit weak as a talented actor like Samutrakani has not been used well actually. The so called hero-villain moments are just about okay and do not create much impact.</p>
  <strong>Music Director:</strong><br>
